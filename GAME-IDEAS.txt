Melee: Should still be projectile, just shorter ranged different animation
Gear: Each piece of gear should support having a skill type being placed in it, and having gems
Skills: Should level up based on usage of the skill. Some skills should be relatively common
    drops, some should be rarer.
Gems: Each gem should support leveling up based on taking/dealing damage for armor/weapons.
    Should give small stat boosts that are slightly boosted when leveled up.
Crafting: Should be able to mine/etc to get materials, leveling up the more you do it.
    More levels = Can mine faster. Some materials will be soft-gated by extremely long mine times until
        you reach certain level.
    Gear can be crafted using materials you find. Will have slightly higher base stats,
        maybe some unique stats/slots for certain types of gear materials, more gem slots
Unsocketing: Can pay fee and materials to remove gem or skill from gear
Fusing: Can fuse similar gems together to pass on part of gem experience to higher level gem, and to sell gems/skills
- No mana, just skill cooldowns and cast times
- To avoid hybrid builds being really strong, gear for different build types can:
    1) Have set bonuses that are better if you have the full set
    2) If this^ isn't enough, skills and/or gear can be stronger for each piece of the same type of gear there is
- Need to think about how economy should look liek around crafting, gear/skill selling,
    and items NPC sells [maybe semi-randomized / limited stock / difficult to find randomly spawned trading vendors]
- Eventing system: Mini events throughout certain parts of the map where NPCs spawn in higher 
    quantities that give higher rewards, or something like that? Maybe they can take over towns
    or vendor areas? Need to think a lot more on this.
